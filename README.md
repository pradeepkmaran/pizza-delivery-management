# pizza-delivery-management
This is a pizza delivery management system that runs on Python in the terminal. It allows the shop owner to create a menu, take orders from customers, and generate order bills. The system also provides information about the availability of pizza items in stock. At the end of the day, the system displays overall order details to the shop owner.  

# Features
# Menu Creation: 
   The shop owner can create and customize a menu for their pizza shop. They can add, update, or remove pizza items along with their prices and available quantities.  
# Order Placement: 
   Customers can place orders by selecting the desired pizza items from the menu. The system checks the availability of each item and prompts the customer if any item is out of stock.  
# Order Bill Generation: 
   After the customer has selected their desired items, the system generates an order bill that includes the total amount to be paid. The bill contains a breakdown of each item's price and quantity.  
# Stock Management: 
   The system keeps track of the available quantity for each pizza item. If an item is out of stock, it is indicated during order placement and is not available for selection.  
# End-of-Day Summary: 
   At the end of the day, the system provides an overall summary of the day's orders to the shop owner. This summary includes the total number of orders, the total revenue generated, and a breakdown of each item's sales.
